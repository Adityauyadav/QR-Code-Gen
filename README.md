Basically my friend asked if I know a website which can help her generate multiple QR Codes for free!

I was surprised by the word "free"? I was like who is charging for QR Code Generation?

Then I got to know this whole thing of sites not allowing for multiple QR Codes, so I just created this for her using my go to python ui helper - streamlit.
